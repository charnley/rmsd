Calculate Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of Two Molecules Using Rotation
===========================================================================

The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is calculated, using Kabsch algorithm
(1976) or Quaternion algorithm (1991) for rotation, between two Cartesian
coordinates in either ``.xyz`` or ``.pdb`` format, resulting in the minimal
RMSD.

For more information please read RMSD_ and `Kabsch algorithm`_.

Motivation
==========

I want to know the minimal RMSD between two molecules
-----------------------------------------------------

You have two molecules, A and B, and want to calculate the structural difference between them. If you just calculate the RMSD straight-forward, you might get too big a value, as seen below. You need to recenter and rotate the two molecules to get the true minimal RMSD. This is what this code does.

I do not know the order of the atoms
------------------------------------

If atoms in molecules A and B are not in the same order, you will need to reorder the atoms first to get the correct rotation for minimal RMSD.

Installation
============

Easiest is to get the program via ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install rmsd


or download the project from GitHub via

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/charnley/rmsd


There is only one Python file, so you can also download `calculate_rmsd.py` and
put it in your bin folder.

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -O calculate_rmsd https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charnley/rmsd/master/rmsd/calculate_rmsd.py
    chmod +x calculate_rmsd

Usage examples
==============

Use ``calculate_rmsd --help`` to see all the features. Usage is pretty straight
forward, call ``calculate_rmsd`` with two structures in either ``.xyz`` or
``.pdb``. In this example Ethane has the exact same structure, but is
translated in space, so the RMSD should be zero.

.. code-block:: bash

    calculate_rmsd tests/ethane.xyz tests/ethane_translate.xyz

It is also possible to ignore all hydrogens (useful for larger molecules where
hydrogens move around indistinguishable) and print the rotated structure for
visual comparison. The output will be in XYZ format.

.. code-block:: bash

    calculate_rmsd --no-hydrogen --print tests/ethane.xyz tests/ethane_mini.xyz

If the atoms are scrambled and not aligned you can use the ``--reorder``
argument which will align the atoms from structure B unto A. Use
``--reorder-method`` to select what method for reordering. Choose between
Hungarian_ (default), distance (very approximate) and brute force (slow).

.. _Hungarian: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm

.. code-block:: bash

    calculate_rmsd --reorder tests/water_16.xyz tests/water_16_idx.xyz

I want to run multiple calculations at the same time. Not everything should be solved by the script, I would recommend that you use GNU Parallel for this use case. For example

.. code-block:: bash

    find tests/resources -name "ethane_*xyz" | parallel -j2 "echo -n '{} ' && calculate_rmsd --reorder --no-hydrogen tests/resources/ethane.xyz {}"

will use two cores and compare all ``ethane_*``molecules. Printing one file and the RMSD per line. Bash is good for stuff like that

It is also possible to use RMSD as a library in other scripts, see
``example.py`` and ``tests/*`` for example usage.

A note on PDB
=============

Protein Data Bank format (PDB) is column-based; however, countless examples of non-standard ``.pdb`` files exist.
We try to read them, but if you have trouble reading the file, check if the file format is compliant with PDB.
For example, some hydrogens are noted as ``HG11``, which we assume is not mercury.
